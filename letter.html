    <h2>To the Girl Who Changed My Life 💖</h2>
    <p>
      Every single day, I find myself in awe of how you’ve woven yourself into the fabric of my life. 
      Loving you isn’t just a feeling; it’s like finally finding the rhythm to a song I’ve been 
      humming my whole life without knowing the words. In a world that is constantly rushing and 
      unpredictable, you are the quiet corner where I finally feel at peace—my absolute pause. 
      I don’t just see a partner in you; I see my safest harbor and the person who makes even the 
      most ordinary moments feel like an adventure. Choosing you is the easiest, most natural 
      decision I have ever made, and I will keep choosing you in every version of reality 
      we ever find ourselves in.
